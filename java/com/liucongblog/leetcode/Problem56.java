     * 56. Merge Intervals
     * <p>
     * Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
     * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
     * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
     * Output: [[1,5]]
     * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
     * intervals[i].length == 2
     * 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
     *
     * @param intervals
     * @return
